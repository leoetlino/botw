      - text: "At the request of Hyrule's king,\na group of outsiders came to\ngreet us at the domain.\nOne of them was a Hylian child of\nonly about four years of age.\nHis name was Link.\nHe made quite a first impression. He was\ncurious and full of energy, with a ready\nsmile. Are all Hylian children that way?\nOne thing that surely sets him apart is\nhis swordsmanship, which I hear is\nexceptional. He has even bested adults.\nHe must be somewhat reckless, however,\nas he was covered in bruises. Wishing to\nbe helpful, I healed his wounds for him.\nIt must have been his first time seeing\nhealing magic, as he looked up at me\nwith big, round eyes. It was...adorable."

It's so big\nand round, with a long, awkward nose.\nAccording to the Sheikah who found\nRuta, Divine Beasts require someone\nworthy to control them.\nIt's fun to imagine someone piloting this\nenormous beast in the distant past.\nI wonder who will have that honor next."

However...\nHe hardly speaks anymore, and smiles\neven more rarely. He is still the kind\nsoul I knew, but something has changed.\nI asked him if something had happened,\nif something was wrong. He merely\nshook his head.\nPerhaps it is his newly acquired height,\nbut I feel he is ever looking past me,\ninto the distance beyond..."

My heart knew at once\nwhat to do. I agreed without reservation.\nCalamity Ganon must not be resurrected.\nIf he is, there is no way to ensure the\nsafety of my people, or of anyone.\nI do not know what will happen. All I\nknow is that if there is anything I can do\nto help, I must try. I must protect Hyrule.\nThere is also that...the Divine Beasts are\nmeant to assist the chosen hero when he\nfaces Ganon. In this way, I can help Link."

It had been ages.\nI told him the Lynel of Ploymus Mountain\nhas been terrorizing everyone lately.\nWhen I said that, he started walking\ntoward the mountain, without a word.\nSpellbound, I followed him there.\nWhen we were almost there, he told me\nto turn back. He insisted he would be\nfine on his own. I stubbornly stayed.\nWhile I argued, the Lynel attacked us\nfrom behind! I was sure we had met\nour end. How silly of me to doubt.\nWith a sure hand and a fierce gleam in\nhis eye, Link unsheathed the sword that\nseals the darkness and defeated our foe.\nHis swordsmanship was swift and\ngraceful. I was fascinated by the\nbeauty of his movements.\nThough I should have been terrified,\nI could not help but feel safe in the\npresence of my dear friend.\nHis kindness and determination to help\nthose in need... His strength and skill...\nMy heart is drawn to his. I am doomed.\nThe last beautiful move Link performed\non the mountain is called a Spin Attack.\nPerhaps I will attempt it with my spear."

Seggin could hardly\nlook at me. Muzu left partway through.\nI feel awful for putting them through this,\nbut I must do what I can to help Link.\nI could never forgive myself otherwise.\nSpeaking of Link... I have at last finished\ngathering the materials for the armor.\nI shall start making it at once."
