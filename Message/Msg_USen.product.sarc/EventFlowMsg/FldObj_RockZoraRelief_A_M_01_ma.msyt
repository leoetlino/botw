Thus, as the legends go,\nthe domain was born 10,000 years ago.\nThe land was also rich in ore, and so a\nunique form of stonemasonry was\ndeveloped to create our new home.\nThe domain is one giant sculpture,\na feat of architecture that has drawn\nadmirers the world over.\nOur great domain will ever stand as a\nhallmark of the esteemed artists who\nmade it, an eternal symbol of Zora pride."

That is why the\nreservoir signifies our bond with Hyrule."

However, once the Great Calamity\nstruck, she was never to return.\nAll of Zora's Domain fell into misery.\nThe merest thought of the princess was\nenough to overcome anyone with tears.\nAs a way of offering her soul repose,\nthey tried to send the Lightscale Trident\ndrifting down the Zora River.\nBut when they did, the trident began to\nglow, and Mipha's voice rang loud and\nclear for all Zora to hear:\n\"The Lightscale Trident and I are one...\nAbandon your grief and know joy once\nagain. Do not cry...just remember.\"\nAnd so, keeping to her request, on the\nday of the Great Calamity...the day that\nMipha passed from this world...\nthe Zora venerate the Lightscale Trident\nand remember their brave princess.\n\nSuch is the origin of the\nChampion Festival."

In a past more distant\nthan even the Great Calamity or the\ncreation of the Divine Beast Vah Ruta...\nThere was a Zora princess named Ruto.\n\n\nWe know that she was an attendant to\nthe Zora patron deity and that she was\na fair and lively girl, beloved to all.\nAround that same time, an evil man with\ndesigns on ruling the world appeared,\nbringing disaster upon Zora's Domain.\nIt is said that Ruto then awoke as a sage,\nfacing this foe alongside the princess of\nHyrule and the hero of legend.\nHer achievements are remembered not\nonly by the Zora, they are also forever\netched in the history of Hyrule.\nThe Divine Beast Vah Ruta, built ages\nlater to face off against Calamity Ganon,\nwas named in honor of Ruto.\nThat the Zora princess—my sweet\ndaughter Mipha—was chosen to\npilot Ruta is surely the work of fate."

My dearest wish is that her soul\nwill know peace. I pray for it every day."

It certainly exceeded\nthe line limits of a single monument.\nI suppose I could have just shortened\nthe text, but it felt wrong to tamper with\nour great king's words.\nThankfully, I was able to split it all\nbetween seven monuments to ensure\nthat every word was preserved.\nI have always prided myself on my ability\nto think outside the box. I am so very\nadaptable! And humble as well.\nWhile I was at it, I thought...why not add\ntwo of my own? And so I created one for\nKing Dorephan and one for Prince Sidon.\nTrue, this is outside the scope of my\ncommission... But I believe their triumphs\ndeserve as much! But why stop at that...\nWhy, indeed! My achievement surely\ndeserves remembrance too. That is how\na commission of one became 10.\nOf course, having increased the number\nof monuments, I had to find places for\nthem all... That proved difficult.\nStill, it is worth it! So long as I remember\nto sign these monuments, my name will\nbe remembered forever. As it should be."
