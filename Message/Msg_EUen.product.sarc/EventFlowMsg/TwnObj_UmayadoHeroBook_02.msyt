Now I'm hungry.\nMaybe I'll track down a prime rock roast\nfor one of my dinners tonight!"

I couldn't\nhelp but admire his Goron-like strength.\nWhile I was distracted, a monster almost\ngot the jump on me. He stopped it.\nThe Great Daruk...saved by a tiny Hylian.\nI must have had a dopey look on\nmy face when that happened.\nHope he didn't notice."

He's got a respectable appetite.\nLoves to eat meat, fruit, vegetables...\nall sorts of things a decent person\nwouldn't dream of eating.\n\nLink will cook up and eat just about\nanything. I offered him some Grade A\nrock roast to help refine his palette.\nI asked him how it tasted. He liked it\nso much, he was speechless.\n\nI knew Hylians could eat rocks too.\n\n\nEating isn't the only thing Link and I\nhave in common. The little guy is also\nincredibly strong!\nHe said sometimes when he focuses,\nit feels like time slows down. Heh!\nI really like that guy.\nHe's the type of guy you can trust to\nhave your back and also have a nice\nhearty meal with.\nYeah! That settles it! From now on,\nLink is an official brother."

I can't think\nof a better brother for the job.\nI hear one of those ancient machine\nthings went nuts during some test\nand shot out deadly beams!\nWith true Goron spirit, Link grabbed a\npot lid from the ground and deflected\nthe blast.\nHe nailed the thing in its weak spot\nand saved the day.\n\nHis bravery caught the king's eye,\nand not long after that, he was\nappointed to guard Zelda!\nI'd expect nothin' less from the\nlittle guy!"

Sounds heavy. They must\nhave been bondin' over their food\npreferences. That'll do it, all right.\nSpeakin' of openin' up, all this journal\nwritin' has made me realize somethin'\nabout myself...\nWriting makes me hungry."
